# GraphQL Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our strategy for gradually migrating the AudioGPraph application from REST to GraphQL. The migration is being done incrementally to minimize risk and allow the team to learn and adapt gradually.

## Current Implementation

### GraphQL Endpoint

We've set up a GraphQL endpoint at `/api/graphql` that coexists with our current REST APIs. The initial implementation includes:

```typescript
// Example of our GraphQL schema
type Artist {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  metrics: [Metric!]
}

type Metric {
  value: Float!
  metric_type: String!
  date: String!
  platform: String!
}
```

### Apollo Client Setup

We've configured Apollo Client in `src/app/providers.tsx`:

```typescript
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "/api/graphql",
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Setup ‚úÖ

- [x] Set up Apollo Server
- [x] Create basic GraphQL schema
- [x] Implement first query resolver
- [x] Configure Apollo Client

### Phase 2: Component Migration üöß

- [x] Create new GraphQL-powered components alongside existing ones
- [ ] Compare performance between REST and GraphQL implementations
- [ ] Gradually replace REST components with GraphQL versions

### Phase 3: Schema Expansion üìù

Planned additions to the schema:

```typescript
type Artist {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  metrics: [Metric!]
  platforms: [Platform!]
  topTracks: [Track!]
  // More fields to be added
}

type Platform {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  platformId: String!
}

type Track {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  plays: Int!
  platform: String!
}
```

## Migration Order

1. **Current Progress**

   - ‚úÖ Artist basic info
   - ‚úÖ Artist metrics
   - üöß Platform integrations

2. **Next Steps**
   - [ ] Artist top tracks
   - [ ] Platform-specific data
   - [ ] User interactions
   - [ ] Real-time updates (subscriptions)

## Benefits of Our Approach

1. **Risk Mitigation**

   - Existing REST endpoints remain functional
   - Easy rollback if needed
   - Gradual learning curve for the team

2. **Performance Improvements**

   - Reduced over-fetching
   - Single network request for related data
   - Efficient caching with Apollo Client

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Type safety with GraphQL schema
   - Better IDE support
   - Simplified data fetching logic

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**

   - Test each resolver independently
   - Verify type definitions
   - Check error handling

2. **Integration Tests**

   - Test queries with multiple related fields
   - Verify data consistency
   - Check caching behavior

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Compare response times with REST
   - Monitor query complexity
   - Test under different load conditions

## Best Practices

1. **Schema Design**

   - Keep types focused and specific
   - Use interfaces for shared fields
   - Document fields and types

2. **Resolvers**

   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use DataLoader for N+1 query prevention
   - Cache expensive operations

3. **Client-Side**
   - Utilize fragments for reusable queries
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Handle errors gracefully
